The apartment is spacious, clean, and quietly located. Check in and out was an automatic process, easy and seamless. The location is a bit farther from Shinjuku where we normally stayed but the cab rides were just less than 1,000 yen each ride, which was quite ok since we were traveling with our older parents. Otherwise the walk will be pleasant alongside the park next door! Thank you Makoto for letting us stay in your apartment. + MoreApril 2016HelpfulDrewThank you Makoto for the use of the apartment. It was clean, very close to rail transportation and all required amenities - great coffee (Counterpart Coffee), eateries, convenience stores and pharmacy.

My name is Kumi. I am originally from Osaka but I spent most of my life oversea (US, UK, France and Australia). I came back to Japan about 5 years ago and now am settled in Tokyo. 



In my spare time, I love to travel, scuba dive, swim, jog, dine out and read at nice cafe in Tokyo. 



I am excited to welcome my guest from all over the world so that they can enjoy their stay in Japan and see the best of this beautiful country. The world has given to me so much so it is my turn to give it back to my amigo all over the world. 



Please feel free to contact me if you need any help at all during your stay and I would be happy to help you with anything! Hope you have a lovely time in Japan.+ MoreResponse rate: 100%(past 30 days)Response time: within an hour

This place is very spacious by Japanese standards! First, Ken  did a great job accommodating us on very short notice. He also was very easy to contact via the app. He was able to meet us at a near by JR station (~5 min walk) and showed us to the duplex himself. He even stocked the fridge with water and beer to welcome us!

The area is very quiet and we always felt safe no matter what time of day or night. The bed was firm, which  I like, and the bathroom shower/tub area is nice and big. The water was hot and had good pressure. The outside patio area looked quite nice, but it was too cold for us to enjoy!  Hopefully next time.  Please note that the shower/tub area and bed are upstairs, and you must be comfortable climbing 1 flight of stairs if mobility is an issue for other guests.

 Ken also supplied mobile wifi, which is lovely to help you get around Tokyo. There are lots of restaurants, shopping, transportation options, etc within a 5-15 min walk. Tokyo is a great city, and this is great place to stay. Would recommend without hesitation.+ MoreMarch 2016HelpfulThis host has 45 reviews for other properties.View Other Reviews","Your HostKenShibuya, Japan · Member since October 2014I am an art dealer enjoing fine arts not only at museums or galleries but at my private room, and I would like to show them to more people. That is why I joined Airbnb.

Besides fine art, I like eating out, cooking, traveling, books, films. You may find my taste during your stay.

I hope you will enjoy ""arts in everyday life"" as much as I do.

Kana was really helpful and friendly, and made me feel welcome. The shared area is really useful and also a nice spot to chillout and meet other travellers. The nearest train station is less than 10 minutes walk and theres a tonne of great resturants and shops around! The only thing that could be improved on is if they put better beds in, as the sofa couch one i stayed on was pretty hard. But that doesnt take away from the overall experience - its great value and well setup, so definitely worth it! + MoreMarch 2016HelpfulErikHad a great time in Tokyo. Enjoyed my stay here. Only one thing bothered me and could (and should) really be improved: the sofa beds are the worst,  they need to be replaced for a real bed or a matras should be provided to go over the existing sofa-bed.
