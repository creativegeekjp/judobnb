		<reviews><![CDATA[JulieMy husband and I had a  wonderful stay at Ken's brand new duplex. This place is very spacious by Japanese standards! First, Ken  did a great job accommodating us on very short notice. He also was very easy to contact via the app. He was able to meet us at a near by JR station (~5 min walk) and showed us to the duplex himself. He even stocked the fridge with water and beer to welcome us!

The area is very quiet and we always felt safe no matter what time of day or night. The bed was firm, which  I like, and the bathroom shower/tub area is nice and big. The water was hot and had good pressure. The outside patio area looked quite nice, but it was too cold for us to enjoy!  Hopefully next time.  Please note that the shower/tub area and bed are upstairs, and you must be comfortable climbing 1 flight of stairs if mobility is an issue for other guests.

 Ken also supplied mobile wifi, which is lovely to help you get around Tokyo. There are lots of restaurants, shopping, transportation options, etc within a 5-15 min walk. Tokyo is a great city, and this is great place to stay. Would recommend without hesitation.+ MoreMarch 2016HelpfulThis host has 45 reviews for other properties.View Other Reviews]]></reviews>
		<your_hosts><![CDATA[Your HostKenShibuya, Japan · Member since October 2014I am an art dealer enjoing fine arts not only at museums or galleries but at my private room, and I would like to show them to more people. That is why I joined Airbnb.

Besides fine art, I like eating out, cooking, traveling, books, films. You may find my taste during your stay.

I hope you will enjoy "arts in everyday life" as much as I do.

		<reviews><![CDATA[ChilliangieMy family of 4 stayed here for only one night before heading to Nagano. The apartment is spacious, clean, and quietly located. Check in and out was an automatic process, easy and seamless. The location is a bit farther from Shinjuku where we normally stayed but the cab rides were just less than 1,000 yen each ride, which was quite ok since we were traveling with our older parents. Otherwise the walk will be pleasant alongside the park next door! Thank you Makoto for letting us stay in your apartment. + MoreApril 2016HelpfulDrewThank you Makoto for the use of the apartment. It was clean, very close to rail transportation and all required amenities - great coffee (Counterpart Coffee), eateries, convenience stores and pharmacy. We truly liked the experience of living in a local neighbourhood but one close, by walking distance, to well known locations. Would definitely stay again.+ MoreApril 2016HelpfulThis host has 2 reviews for other properties.View Other Reviews]]></reviews>

My name is Kumi. I am originally from Osaka but I spent most of my life oversea (US, UK, France and Australia). I came back to Japan about 5 years ago and now am settled in Tokyo. 



In my spare time, I love to travel, scuba dive, swim, jog, dine out and read at nice cafe in Tokyo. 



I am excited to welcome my guest from all over the world so that they can enjoy their stay in Japan and see the best of this beautiful country. The world has given to me so much so it is my turn to give it back to my amigo all over the world. 



Please feel free to contact me if you need any help at all during your stay and I would be happy to help you with anything! Hope you have a lovely time in Japan.+ MoreResponse rate: 100%(past 30 days)Response time: within an hour

Kana was really helpful and friendly, and made me feel welcome. The shared area is really useful and also a nice spot to chillout and meet other travellers. The nearest train station is less than 10 minutes walk and theres a tonne of great resturants and shops around!

Ils m'ont conseillé des restaurants, donné des plans de la ville et ils m'ont même prêté un "wifi pocket" pour que je puisse me repérer à Tokyo pendant mon séjour chez eux. Je vous le conseille sans hésiter, merci à vous !+ MoreApril 2016HelpfulResponse from Tet:Thank you so much! We hope your very nice trip! See you again!! April 2016ErinI really enjoyed my stay with Tetsu and Nana in Tokyo! Nana is super sweet and a wonderful cook. Tetsu is awesome and had great suggestions for what to do and eat in the city. In terms of the room, a part of the apartment is sectioned off by curtains for guests. This section includes a comfy bed, table, chairs and a lamp. Their apartment is also in a very nice part of Tokyo and it's easy to get around by subway. I would definitely recommend staying with Tetsu and Nana!+ MoreMarch 2016HelpfulNanaStaying at Tet place was very nice!!  It was the first time that I went to Tokyo and it would not have been as awesome if not for meeting Tet and his girlfriend. They are both really good people and took great care of me, even to an extent, that you wouldn't normally expect. The location of the flat was easily acessable via train and not difficult to find at all. You can easily go to Sinjuku,Shibuya,Ikebukuro at no time at all as well. The flat itself was really clean and comfortable, as was the bed. If you may have the chance, give his girlfriends food a try. What I ate was amazingly delicious. I can really recommend staying at Tet!+ MoreMarch 2016Helpful]]></reviews>

I'd definitely stay again.+ MoreMarch 2016HelpfulKimthe best house i've ever stayed at Airbnb. Hosts (4~5 people) were so kind and willing to help. They (especially Daiki) tried to communicate with me in English and teach me some Japanese sentences. Also, they invited me BBQ which was the best experience in this trip. Have you ever imagine it 'BBQ under the lights of Tokyo Tower'? (It's not well seen though..lol) Even they had small party about 8pm, because I was with them and it was not a big party, I never think I had the noise problem. The bed was not bad and shower water was nice. If Im back here, I would stay here for sure. I would give 5 out of 5 for this house

For its price, I honestly could not have been happier. Shower water was well heated, and the room has great insulation that goes with the heater. Even the futon was thick to last to remain comfortable for the night. If I'm back in Japan, I would definitely go for this room again. You need a subway pass to get around major areas though, so make sure you get the 3 day passes to travel Tokyo comfortably.+ MoreMarch 2016Helpful1Mario IvanThe room and location is perfect and  it is only like 15 minute walk to Shinagawa Eki which is on the Yamanote Line which is what you want if you are doing the tourist areas !!
The guys are very friendly and helpful if you need anything ...there is also a 100 yen Lawson pretty much next door open 24 /7 if you need anything.. I stayed there 6 days and no problems at all .. I also was out pretty much every day from early morning till late !! definitely recommend this place and would stay again if I visit Tokyo in the future !!

I hope you can find the feeling of home when staying at my house, not just stay in a temporary place like hotels. So not like some other airbnbers, I didn't make the house like a hotel. I think our guest may need a cosy place where he can experience something special when they're traveling:)

You may make use of the bike parkinglot in the LB floor. Some in the same building may say good morning to you, you just nod your head to response, everyone is of hospitality here.Interaction with GuestsI will go to India for a Yoga course until April and may not meet you in person unfortunately. However, a friend of mine will be online 24/7 and can help you to deal with issues and I can reply your msg on Airbnb also :)The NeighborhoodJust in the middle of the famous skyscraper area of Shinjuku. Very close to station. There are convenience stores, a lots restaurants and cafe near my house. Also two big super market within 8 min walk.Getting Around1 min walking to Nishi-shinjuku subway station.
10 min walking to Shinjuku station.
Access any major place in Tokyo within one transfer.
Very easy to access any major train and subway lines in Tokyo.Other Things to NoteI have a cat for a year.
