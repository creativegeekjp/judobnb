This place is very spacious by Japanese standards! First, Ken  did a great job accommodating us on very short notice. He also was very easy to contact via the app. He was able to meet us at a near by JR station (~5 min walk) and showed us to the duplex himself. He even stocked the fridge with water and beer to welcome us!

The area is very quiet and we always felt safe no matter what time of day or night. The bed was firm, which  I like, and the bathroom shower/tub area is nice and big. The water was hot and had good pressure. The outside patio area looked quite nice, but it was too cold for us to enjoy!  Hopefully next time.  Please note that the shower/tub area and bed are upstairs, and you must be comfortable climbing 1 flight of stairs if mobility is an issue for other guests.

 Ken also supplied mobile wifi, which is lovely to help you get around Tokyo. There are lots of restaurants, shopping, transportation options, etc within a 5-15 min walk. Tokyo is a great city, and this is great place to stay. Would recommend without hesitation.+ MoreMarch 2016HelpfulThis host has 45 reviews for other properties.View Other Reviews","Your HostKenShibuya, Japan · Member since October 2014I am an art dealer enjoing fine arts not only at museums or galleries but at my private room, and I would like to show them to more people. That is why I joined Airbnb.

Besides fine art, I like eating out, cooking, traveling, books, films. You may find my taste during your stay.

I hope you will enjoy ""arts in everyday life"" as much as I do.
