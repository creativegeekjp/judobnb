My name is Kumi. I am originally from Osaka but I spent most of my life oversea (US, UK, France and Australia). I came back to Japan about 5 years ago and now am settled in Tokyo. 



In my spare time, I love to travel, scuba dive, swim, jog, dine out and read at nice cafe in Tokyo. 



I am excited to welcome my guest from all over the world so that they can enjoy their stay in Japan and see the best of this beautiful country. The world has given to me so much so it is my turn to give it back to my amigo all over the world. 



Please feel free to contact me if you need any help at all during your stay and I would be happy to help you with anything! Hope you have a lovely time in Japan.+ MoreResponse rate: 100%(past 30 days)Response time: within an hour

April 2016ErinI really enjoyed my stay with Tetsu and Nana in Tokyo! Nana is super sweet and a wonderful cook. Tetsu is awesome and had great suggestions for what to do and eat in the city. In terms of the room, a part of the apartment is sectioned off by curtains for guests. This section includes a comfy bed, table, chairs and a lamp. Their apartment is also in a very nice part of Tokyo and it's easy to get around by subway. I would definitely recommend staying with Tetsu and Nana!+ MoreMarch 2016HelpfulNanaStaying at Tet place was very nice!!  It was the first time that I went to Tokyo and it would not have been as awesome if not for meeting Tet and his girlfriend. They are both really good people and took great care of me, even to an extent, that you wouldn't normally expect. The location of the flat was easily acessable via train and not difficult to find at all. You can easily go to Sinjuku,Shibuya,Ikebukuro at no time at all as well. The flat itself was really clean and comfortable, as was the bed. If you may have the chance, give his girlfriends food a try. What I ate was amazingly delicious. I can really recommend staying at Tet!+ MoreMarch 2016Helpful","Your HostTetTokyo, Japan · Member since March 2016I was born in Japan and grown up in America in my childhood.
