            Airbnb hosts share their spaces in 190 countries and more than 34,000 cities. All you have to do is enter your destination and travel dates into the search bar to discover distinctive places to stay, anywhere in the world.

                We display photos of listings, host profiles, and reviews to help you make informed decisions when considering a host's space. We've also created search filters so you can narrow your results by type of accommodation, price, and location. For example, if you’re looking to make friends and stay with a host, select Private Room or Shared Room. Or if you’re looking for an entire space to call your own, go ahead and select the Entire Place filter.
              
            
            
              
                Contacting hosts to book a stay
              
              
                Once you complete your profile to give hosts a good idea of the kind of guest you are, you can request to book a host's space by clicking the Contact Host or Request to Book buttons, or you can use  Instant Book to confirm your stay without having to wait for a host's approval.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    
      
        
          
            Book
          
          
            There are a few ways to book spaces on Airbnb. Some hosts want to get to know a guest before they confirm a reservation while others prefer to reduce the time it takes to manage requests by using Airbnb's Instant Book feature.

                Buttons to book a stay on Airbnb
              
              
                The Request to Book button sends a reservation request to a host for the specific trip dates you select. The host has the option to either accept or decline the request, or ask you questions about your trip. When a host responds to your request, we send you an email to let you know. If they don't respond within 24 hours, your request simply expires.
              
              
                The Instant Book button immediately confirms your reservation and closes the host's calendar to other incoming requests. We send you a receipt by email with your trip's details, and your host may follow up with you, too.
              
              
                The Contact Host button lets you start a conversation about their space and hosting style through our secure messaging system. You can use our messaging system to discuss trip details, request special prices, or ask about specific amenities.
              
            
            
              
                Payment and confirmation
              
              
                Whether you use the Request to Book button or the  Instant Book button, we'll ask for your payment details so we can hold your reservation.
              
              
                If you use the Request to Book button to send a request, the host has 24 hours to respond. We won't charge your payment method until the host accepts your reservation. Once the host accepts, we process your payment and send you a congratulatory email that includes your receipt, trip details, and best wishes for a great trip. If you don't hear back within 24 hours, your request automatically expires.
              
              
                If you use the Instant Book button, your reservation will be immediately confirmed and we'll process your payment right away.

                Before you get there
              
              
                Send a message to your host to arrange a check-in time and arrival details like picking up the key. Then  download the Airbnb app  so you can stay in the know while on the go.
              
              
                We'll send you an email that includes your trip itinerary, receipt, and host contact information. You can also view your reservation details, alter your plans, or cancel your reservation from the My Trips section on your personal account page.
              
            
            
              
                During your trip
              
              
                We encourage you to have the time of your life! Enjoy your host's home and city as if it were a friend's, and remember to be considerate of your neighbors. If any issues arise during your trip, be sure to get in touch with your host. In most cases, they'll be the person best equipped to help you. If your host can't solve the problem, please  contact us.
              
            
            
              
                After you travel
              
              
                Write a review about your host and their space so other travelers can learn through your experience. Your host will also have a chance to write a review for you, too. Then, pick the next place you'd love to go and find a space on Airbnb!

            We encourage you to share all kinds of spaces on Airbnb! Whether you’re offering a seaside villa or an air mattress in the corner of your living room, it’s free to  list your space. When you’re ready to start welcoming guests, you can publish your listing for the world to see.

                Description and amenities
              
              
                Guests often search for spaces that meet specific needs, so accurately describing your listing and the amenities you offer will help attract the kinds of guests that are best for you. When telling the story of your space, answer important questions like whether or not you have Wifi, and include helpful details about the character, activities, and transportation options in the surrounding area.
              
            
            
              
                Photos
              
              
                Photographs help guests picture themselves in your space. Go ahead and upload up to 24 images, and make sure your photos are well lit, in focus, and representative of the actual space your guests have access to.
              
              
                We love lush imagery, so we offer free professional photography to active hosts in most areas. Apply online  and we'll send a professional photographer to capture your listing in its best light.
              
            
            
              
                Pricing and availability
              
              
                You know your space and your schedule best, so we let you decide the price and we ask you to update your calendar to reflect when it’s available to rent. We also allow you to set custom prices for individual nights and weekends, special events, and monthly stays. We display your listing at the price you set and when you indicate that your space is unavailable, we make sure not to show it in search results.

            A Community Built on Sharing
          
          
            Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to  create a free Airbnb account  so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world

                Profiles
              
              
                No two hosts or travelers are the same, so personal Airbnb profiles help hosts and guests learn more about each other before sharing a space. Airbnb doesn't display full names or contact information on public profiles, so the community can feel confident that their information is safe.

                From futons on the floor to castles on the hilltop, each Airbnb listings is unique. Search results feature entire homes, private rooms, and shared rooms at every price point. Hosts describe their space in detail, including available amenities and arrival and departure times, and guests leave reviews about their experience.
              
            
            
              
                Host Groups and Community Meetups
              
              
                Airbnb helps its community stay connected through online forums and real-life meetups. Airbnb Groups gives hosts an online space to come together to share stories, insights, and advice.

                Verifications
              
              
                Airbnb puts hosts and travelers at ease with features like Verified ID and public reviews. Having a Verified ID indicates that you've completed a specific set of verifications—offline ID, online ID, profile photo, email address, and phone number. Hosts and guests also build trust and cultivate their reputations by writing reviews about their experiences after each trip.
              
            
            
              
                Messaging
              
              
                Our messaging system ensures that communication between hosts and guests stays on Airbnb so your contact information remains private until you have a confirmed reservation. For your peace of mind, we've added reporting features so you can easily notify us if you ever feel uncomfortable.
              
            
            
              
                Payment System
              
              
                Our convenient payment system supports many currencies and several types of payment and payout methods. Airbnb collects guest payments from the moment they make a reservation and waits until 24 hours after arrival before releasing funds to the host. This way, guests and hosts can feel confident knowing that Airbnb will process and deliver payments when a reservation is honored.
